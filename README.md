# Combined FTP project

## Project Overview

This project consists of the design and implementation of an **FTP infrastructure** using **Vagrant** and **Ansible**, following **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** principles.
The project is developed collaboratively, with task management and version control handled through **GitHub** and **GitHub Projects**.

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Anonymous FTP Server** – FTP service with anonymous, read-only access.
2. **Secure FTP Server** – FTP service with authenticated and secure access, based on the structure of the anonymous FTP implementation.
