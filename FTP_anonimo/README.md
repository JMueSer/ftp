# FTP-ANONIMO
First part of FTP practice

# STEPS

1. Create the Vagrantfile
2. Create all the Ansible files (playbook, inventory and roles)
3. Run the practice with "vagrant up" command and check for possible errors
4. Access the VM through ssh (if we want to check services status or configuration files)
5. Make the propper checks from the host that fulfils the practice requirements
